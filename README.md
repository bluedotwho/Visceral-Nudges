# Visceral-Nudges
This project investigates how intangible human experiences can be translated into tangible interactions through visceral nudges, subtle design interventions that evoke instinctive and emotional responses. The early phase explored an emotional terrarium where natural elements such as light, mist, and thunder represented joy, sadness, and anger.
